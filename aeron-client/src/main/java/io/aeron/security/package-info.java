/**
 * Basic security infrastructure for authenticating sessions by delegating to a supplied instance of an
 * {@link io.aeron.security.Authenticator}.
 * <p>
 * New connection requests will be allocated a unique 64-bit session identity which is first passed to
 * {@link io.aeron.security.Authenticator#onConnectRequest(long, byte[], long)}. Once the response stream to the client
 * is connected then the system will make periodic calls to
 * {@link io.aeron.security.Authenticator#onConnectedSession(io.aeron.security.SessionProxy, long)} until the
 * {@link io.aeron.security.Authenticator} updates the status of the {@link io.aeron.security.SessionProxy} to indicate
 * if the session is authenticated, needs challenged, or is rejected.
